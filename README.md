Front-end part of our project at the 2023 spring's devrbdige academy.

Front-end technologies used where react, typescript and materialUI. Code quality was looked at carefully so there where many EsLint rules so that our code stays as consistent as possible, so you must run "npm run pre-commit" so that your code gets properly checked and formated based on these EsLint rules.
